# MySQL Burger Eater

## What is it?

**A burger logger created with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!).** 

Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.
Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

The app stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

The most current version of the site is deployed at https://stormy-island-39689.herokuapp.com/ .

## Technologies Used

* HTML5
* CSS3
* Javascript
* JQuery
* MVC Design Pattern
* Bootstrap
* Handlebars.js
* MySQL
* Node.js/npm packages
* Express.js

## Browser and Screen Compatibility

### Browser Tests

The site has been tested so far in Chrome, Firefox, and the latest version of Internet Explorer.
It functions fully on all of these browsers.

Plans to test on Safari upcoming.

### Screen Compatibility Tests

The site is best viewed on a larger desktop (about 1680x1050), but looks good on essentially any non-mobile device's screen resolution. This includes both a 10" and 12" Netbook, a 13" and 15" notebook, 19"-24" desktops, Kindle Fire, Asus Nexus 7, iPad and iPad Pro, Samsung Galaxy tab, Microsoft Surface Pro, and 480p, 720p and 1080p televisions. 

When loaded properly, the homepage should look like this:

## Future Plans for Improvement
* Use media queries to make the site look better on mobile.
* Add individual user accounts/logins (so each inidivdual user can have their own set of devoured and non-devoured burgers).
